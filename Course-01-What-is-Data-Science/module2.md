Cloud computing : 

charateristis : 
- on demand self service.
- broad network access 
- resouce pooling (cost efficent)
- rapid elastics
- measured  service only used resource payment
 

 - technology as service
 - remote service over internet only
 - changed  the way how world consumes compute services (cost efficient, more agile in response change)


 Cloud deployment model:
 public, private(single service) and hybrid(mix of public and private)


 cloud service models : 

 IAAS(without managing or operating we can use infrastucure and physical computers resouses such as servers,networkings,storage) Eg : AWS ,PAAS develop resources need deploy over internet() eg: github,redhat,SAAS software and application are liscense(on demand software, subscription basis)


using cloud -> upto date tools , accessible eveywhere and and any timezone.
as access data simultaneoulsy 

v's of big data : 
velocity,volume,variety text,video,audio(diversity of data),veracity(facts and accuracy) and value(trun data into value) 
-> derive value from big data


NOTE :  Big data was started by Google when Google tried to figure out how how to solve their PageRank algorithm.

Big data is data that is large enough and has enough volume and velocity that you cannot handle it with traditional data database system
